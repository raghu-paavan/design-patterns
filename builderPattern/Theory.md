In this example, we're implementing the Builder design pattern to create a `Meal` object that can have various components like a burger, fries, a drink, and optionally a dessert. The goal is to construct a `Meal` object with these components while keeping the construction process flexible and understandable.

Let's break down the components of this implementation:

### 1. `Meal` class:
- Represents the complex object to be constructed (`burger`, `fries`, `drink`, `dessert`).
- It has a private constructor that takes a `Builder` object to construct the `Meal`.

### 2. `Builder` class:
- An inner static class within `Meal` responsible for constructing the `Meal` object.
- It includes methods (`withBurger`, `withFries`, `withDrink`, `withDessert`) for setting various components of the `Meal`.
- The `build()` method creates and returns the final `Meal` object using the provided components.

### 3. `main()` method:
- Demonstrates how to use the Builder pattern to create a `Meal` object.
- Constructs a `Meal` object using the fluent interface provided by the `Builder`.
- Only includes the components the user specifies, leaving out optional components if not provided.

### Usage of the Builder Pattern:
1. **Flexibility:** You can create a `Meal` object with any combination of components, specifying only the ones you need.
2. **Readability:** The fluent interface (`withBurger`, `withFries`, etc.) improves readability and makes the code more expressive.
3. **Avoiding Telescoping Constructors:** Instead of having multiple constructors with different combinations of parameters, the Builder consolidates the construction process.

In summary, the Builder design pattern allows for the creation of complex objects by providing a clear step-by-step construction process, enabling the creation of objects with different configurations without making the class constructor overly complex or verbose.
